Description of Experiment
}
The purpose of this computational experiment is to show the improvement
of performance by grammar {\bf and} language tuning.
 
The {\bf problem environment} is the k-symmetry problem: 
Finding a boolean expression (with and, or, and not)
which is TRUE for symmetric k-bit strings.
 
The {\bf solution method} is grammar-based genetic programming
(option {\tt algorithm="sgp"}  of {\tt xegaRun}).
The {\bf solver} used is {\tt xegaRun} from the R-package {\tt xega}.
 
The experiment consists of 10 treatments, 2 grammars for 5 problem sizes $k\in 2,\dots, 6$.
