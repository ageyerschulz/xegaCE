Growth of Complexity?
}
\begin{itemize}
\item Complexity grows in steps of 2 of k.
       The 2- and 3-symmetry problem need the same boolean expression,
       but with different variables:
       For the 2-symmetry problem, D1 and D2.
       For the 3-symmetry problem, D1 and D3,
       D2 is ignored.
\item Grammar T5 scales well with problem size growth.
 
  {\bf Reason:} The combination of {\bf grammar} and
        {\bf language} tuning.
 
The generation of pairs of symbols
                 (grammar tuning) \\
  and the new function sPair. It takes a 
  symbol pair as its arguments eliminates the need to expand a 
  a non-terminal twice with the same symbol pair
  (language tuning).
