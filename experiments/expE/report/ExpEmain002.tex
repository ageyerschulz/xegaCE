{\bf Grammar tuning} means adding additional production rules
to a context-free grammar with the goal of improving the learning
performance of grammar-based genetic programming algorithms.
 
{\bf Example:} Repeating production rules allows to change the distribution
of programs (and their sizes) generated during the initialization a grammar-based
genetic programming algorithm.
