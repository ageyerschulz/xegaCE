Description of Experiment
}
The purpose of this computational experiment is to find out
which algorithm performs better, genetic algorithms or differential evolution
for the training of a feed-forward neural network for k-symmetry problems.
 
The {\bf problem environment} is the k-symmetry problem: 
Finding a boolean expression (with and, or, and not)
which is TRUE for symmetric k-bit strings.
 
The {\bf solution method} is grammar-based genetic programming
(options {\tt algorithm="sga"} and {\tt algorithm="sgde"}  of {\tt xegaRun}).
The {\bf solver} used is {\tt xegaRun} from the R-package {\tt xega}.
 
The experiment consists of 10 treatments, 2 algorithms for 5 problem sizes $k\in 2,\dots, 6$.
