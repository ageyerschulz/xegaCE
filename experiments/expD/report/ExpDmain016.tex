For the 2, 3, 4, and 5-symmetry problems,
{\bf differential evolution} needs {\bf statistically significant fewer} generations
(non-overlapping notches in all Box-plots) than a {\bf genetic algorithm}.
 
{\bf Differential evolution} should be preferred.
 
For $k=6$ (and beyond) the parameter {\tt generation} should be increased considerably
for both algorithms.
