Suggestions for Further Experiments
}
\begin{itemize}
\item The fitness function of the NN and the error rate do not correspond.
       The reporting mechanism of the experiment shoud be adapted to report both performance measures.
\item The convexity of the NN loss function has not been exploited.
       Experiments with fitness scaling (genetic algorithms)
       and selection functions (differential evolution) should be performed.
\item Repeat the experiment with optimal parameters for both algorithms.
       Find optimal hyper-parameters for both algorithms first!
\item Study the balance between population size and number of generations needed!
\end{itemize}
