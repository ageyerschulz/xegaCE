 \frametitle{Is variable Generations of treatment BoolT1SGPreplayZa normal?}
 {\bf Normality Test.} The normality of variable Generations of treatment BoolT1SGPreplayZa of experiment ExpC is tested at a significance level 0.05.

 Outliers are not removed (coef=0).
 
 The test-statistic W of the Shapiro-Wilk normality test is 0.541 with a p-value of 0 .
 Since the p-value 0 is below or equal the significance level $\alpha= 0.05 $,
 variable {\bf  Generations } of treatment {\bf  BoolT1SGPreplayZa } of experiment ExpC  is {\bf significantly different} from a normal distribution.
