 For variable Generations of treatments BoolT1SGPreplayZa and BoolT1SGPreplayZb of experiment ExpC:

\vspace{1mm}
{\bf Hypothesis 0}: mean(Generations of BoolT1SGPreplayZa) - mean(Generations of BoolT1SGPreplayZb) is equal to 0.


 \begin{center} is tested at a significance level 0.05 against: \end{center}

{\bf Hypothesis 1}: mean(Generations of BoolT1SGPreplayZa) - mean(Generations of BoolT1SGPreplayZb) is not equal to 0.

 Outliers of treatment BoolT1SGPreplayZa  are not removed (coef=0).

 Outliers of treatment BoolT1SGPreplayZb  are not removed (coef=0).

 The test-statistic W of the Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction is 4998 with a p-value of 0.995 .
 Since the p-value 0.995 is above the significance level $\alpha= 0.05 $,
 for variable Generations of treatments BoolT1SGPreplayZa and BoolT1SGPreplayZb of experiment ExpC 
 {\bf Hypothesis 0}: mean(Generations of BoolT1SGPreplayZa) - mean(Generations of BoolT1SGPreplayZb) is equal to 0.
