Result
}
Each treatment produces a sample drawn from the {\bf same} random process.
 
{\bf Evidence:}
 
The standard deviation $sd$ of each treatment is {\bf not} $0.00$
(for any number of trials).
 
The treatments find 14 and 17 {\bf different, but equivalent} boolean expressions.
(See solution tables in section B Treatements.)
 
Different seeds (may) result in {\bf different samples}:
 
The hypothesis test {\bf supports} the conjecture
that the sample means of the variable Generations of the treatments are equal.
This implies that the two treatments come from the same random process.
