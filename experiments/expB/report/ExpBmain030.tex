Growth of Complexity?
}
\begin{itemize}
\item Complexity grows in steps of 2.
       E.g. the 2- and 3-symmetry problem need the same boolean expression,
       but with different variables:
       For the 2-symmetry problem, D1 and D2.
       For the 3-symmetry problem, D1 and D3.
In the 3-symmetry problem, the middle variable is ignored.
\item The search problem grows harder, because of the need to include all 
       relevant variable pairs twice into the solution.
