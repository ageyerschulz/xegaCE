Do we always find the optimal program?
}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf No.} The non-zero elements in the first table
         indicate the mean number of remaining errors given
         a limit of 500 generations.
\item The standard boolean grammar (T0) has the highest error rate
  for the 4, 5, and 6-symmetry problems given a limit of 500 generations.
\item The grammars T3 and T4 have only problems with the 6-symmetry problem
       given a limit of 500 generations.
\item For the 6-symmetry problem, the grammar T0 has at least 4 errors.
\end{itemize}
