Which grammar performs best?
}
\begin{itemize}
\item Grammar T4 performs best (mean number of generations).
  But not always for the medians (e.g. Box-plot for 4-symmetry).
 
Statistically significant? No - for medians. Not tested for means.
\item Grammar T0 performs worst.
\item Grammar tuning works:
 All modified grammars perform better than the grammar T0.
\end{itemize}
