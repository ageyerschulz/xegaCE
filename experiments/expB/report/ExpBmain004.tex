Description of Experiment
}
The two control variables in this experiment are
\begin{itemize}
\item The bit-length of the k-symmetry problem: 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
\item The grammar for boolean expressions:
\begin{itemize} 
\item {\bf T0}: A standard grammar for boolean expressions.
\item {\bf T1}: A standard grammar for boolean expressions.
            With two rules for OR and a rule for a template 
            which tests for the symmetry of two bits.
\item {\bf T2}: With two rules for AND and one rule for variables replaced
            by symmetric pairs.
\item {\bf T3}: With two rules for OR and one rule variables replaced
            by symmetric pairs.
\item {\bf T4}: With two rules for OR and two rules for variables replaced
            by symmetric pairs.
\end{itemize}
