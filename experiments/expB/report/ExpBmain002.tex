Definition
}
{\bf Families of functions} are parametrized functions whose difficulty
can be controlled by one or more parameters.
 
{\bf Example:} The family of k-symmetry functions.
The k-symmetry problem requires finding a function which classifies
a k-bit string as symmetric.
The parameter $k$ defines the length of the bit string.
The problem is NP hard, because the number of test cases increases by $2^k$.
