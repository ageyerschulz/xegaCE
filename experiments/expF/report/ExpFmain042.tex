Integrate grammar and language tuning
into grammar-based genetic programming algorithms!
  
{\bf Mechanisms:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Automatic function definitions.
\item Make optimal solutions of small problem instances reusable.
\item Grammar evolution from frontiers of derivation trees.
\item Very few, but costly outliers in execution time. (12-symmetry: 5:30h.)
\end{itemize}
 
Testing by sampling?
