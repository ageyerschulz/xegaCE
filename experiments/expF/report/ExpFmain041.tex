Growth of Complexity?
}
\begin{itemize}
\item Complexity grows in steps of 2 of k.
       The 2 and 3, 4 and 5, 6 and 7, 8 and 9, 10 and 11 took 
       a similar number of generations.
{\bf Reason:}
       The 2- and 3-symmetry problem need the same boolean expression,
       but with different variables:
       For the 2-symmetry problem, D1 and D2.
       For the 3-symmetry problem, D1 and D3,
       D2 is ignored.
\item The number of generations grows slower than the time needed.
 
  {\bf Reason:} The cost of testing a boolean expression grows with $2^k$
