Description of Experiment
}
The purpose of this computational experiment is to show the difference
between {\bf exact} and {\bf stochastic} replicability of the experiment.
 
The {\bf problem environment} is the 3-symmetry problem: 
Finding a boolean expression (with and, or, and not)
which is TRUE for symmetric 3-bit strings.
 
The {\bf solution method} is grammar-based genetic programming
(option {\tt algorithm="sgp"}  of {\tt xegaRun}).
The {\bf solver} used is {\tt xegaRun} from the R-package {\tt xega}.
 
The experiment consists of 4 treatments, two for each choice of seeding.
