Result
}
Each treatment is deterministic.
 
{\bf Evidence:}
 
The standard deviation $sd$ of each treatment is $0.00$
(for any number of trials).
 
Only 1 solution is found by repeated trials.
 
Different seeds (may) result in different results:
One treatment needs 1 generation, the other 2 generations to reach the optimum.
