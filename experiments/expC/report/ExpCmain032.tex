 For variable Generations of treatments BoolT1SGPreplayZa and BoolT1SGPreplayZb of experiment ExpC:

\vspace{1mm}
{\bf Hypothesis 0}: mean(Generations of BoolT1SGPreplayZa)=1.39 - mean(Generations of BoolT1SGPreplayZb)=1.29 is equal to 0.


 \begin{center} is tested at a significance level 0.05 against: \end{center}

{\bf Hypothesis 1}: mean(Generations of BoolT1SGPreplayZa)=1.39 - mean(Generations of BoolT1SGPreplayZb)=1.29 is not equal to 0.
\vspace{1mm}
\vspace{1mm}

 12 outliers of treatment BoolT1SGPreplayZa are removed (coef=1.5).

 8 outliers of treatment BoolT1SGPreplayZb are removed (coef=1.5).
\vspace{1mm}
 
 The test-statistic W of the Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction is 4228 with a p-value of 0.493 .
 Since the p-value 0.493 is above the significance level $\alpha= 0.05 $,
 for variable Generations of treatments BoolT1SGPreplayZa and BoolT1SGPreplayZb of experiment ExpC 
 {\bf Hypothesis 0}: mean(Generations of BoolT1SGPreplayZa)=1.39 - mean(Generations of BoolT1SGPreplayZb)=1.29 is equal to 0.
