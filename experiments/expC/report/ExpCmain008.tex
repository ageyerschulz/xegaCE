Treatments 1 and 2 test the seeding of the random number generator in xegaRun:
 
Repetition of a treatment should produce exactly the same result.
But different seeds should lead to different results.
 
Treatments 3 and 4 use the system seed of the random number generator:
 
Repetitions produce random results.
 
We expect that for enough trials both treatments have the same mean performance.
