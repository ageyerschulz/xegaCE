 For variable Generations of treatments MCSGP and SQSGP of experiment ExpA:

\vspace{1mm}
{\bf Hypothesis 0}: mean(Generations of MCSGP)=6.41 - mean(Generations of SQSGP)=6.23 is equal to 0.


 \begin{center} is tested at a significance level 0.05 against: \end{center}

{\bf Hypothesis 1}: mean(Generations of MCSGP)=6.41 - mean(Generations of SQSGP)=6.23 is not equal to 0.

 4 outliers of treatment MCSGP are removed (coef=1.5).

 7 outliers of treatment SQSGP are removed (coef=1.5).
\vspace{1mm}
 
 The test-statistic W of the Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction is 19458 with a p-value of 0.623 .
 Since the p-value 0.623 is above the significance level $\alpha= 0.05 $,
 for variable Generations of treatments MCSGP and SQSGP of experiment ExpA 
 {\bf Hypothesis 0}: mean(Generations of MCSGP)=6.41 - mean(Generations of SQSGP)=6.23 is equal to 0.
is {\bf accepted}.
