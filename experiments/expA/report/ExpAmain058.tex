 Outliers of treatment SQSGP  are not removed (coef=0).

 Outliers of treatment SQSGV  are not removed (coef=0).

 The test-statistic W of the Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction is 10678 with a p-value of 1 .
 Since the p-value 1 is above the significance level $\alpha= 0.05 $,
 for variable Generations of treatments SQSGP and SQSGV of experiment ExpA 
 {\bf Hypothesis 0}: mean(Generations of SQSGP)=6.7 - mean(Generations of SQSGV)=14.9 is equal or less than 0.
is {\bf accepted}.
