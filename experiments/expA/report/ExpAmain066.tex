 Outliers of treatment MCSGP  are not removed (coef=0).

 Outliers of treatment MCSGE  are not removed (coef=0).

 The test-statistic W of the Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction is 12792 with a p-value of 0 .
 Since the p-value 0 is below the significance level $\alpha= 0.05 $,
 for variable Seconds of treatments MCSGP and MCSGE of experiment ExpA 
 {\bf Hypothesis 0}: mean(Seconds of MCSGP)=3.5 - mean(Seconds of MCSGE)=12.9 is equal to 0.
