 The test-statistic W of the Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction is 8326 with a p-value of 0 .
 Since the p-value 0 is below the significance level $\alpha= 0.05 $,
 for variable Seconds of treatments MCSGE and MCSGV of experiment ExpA 
 {\bf Hypothesis 0}: mean(Seconds of MCSGE)=12.9 - mean(Seconds of MCSGV)=32.8 is equal to 0.
