 For variable Generations of treatments MCSGV and SQSGV of experiment ExpA:

{\bf Hypothesis 0}: mean(Generations of MCSGV)=12.7 - mean(Generations of SQSGV)=13.8 is equal to 0.


 \begin{center} is tested at a significance level 0.05 against: \end{center}

{\bf Hypothesis 1}: mean(Generations of MCSGV)=12.7 - mean(Generations of SQSGV)=13.8 is not equal to 0.

 6 outliers of treatment MCSGV are removed (coef=1.5).

 5 outliers of treatment SQSGV are removed (coef=1.5).
\vspace{1mm}
 
 The test-statistic W of the Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction is 17416 with a p-value of 0.176 .
 Since the p-value 0.176 is above the significance level $\alpha= 0.05 $,
 for variable Generations of treatments MCSGV and SQSGV of experiment ExpA 
 {\bf Hypothesis 0}: mean(Generations of MCSGV)=12.7 - mean(Generations of SQSGV)=13.8 is equal to 0.
is {\bf accepted}.
