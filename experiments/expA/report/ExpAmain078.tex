 The test-statistic W of the Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction is 25130 with a p-value of 0.00001 .
 Since the p-value 0.00001 is below the significance level $\alpha= 0.05 $,
 for variable Generations of treatments MCSGE and MCSGV of experiment ExpA 
 {\bf Hypothesis 0}: mean(Generations of MCSGE)=53.8 - mean(Generations of MCSGV)=13.7 is equal to 0.
