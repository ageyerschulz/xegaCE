 The test-statistic W of the Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction is 7360 with a p-value of 0 .
 Since the p-value 0 is below the significance level $\alpha= 0.05 $,
 for variable Generations of treatments MCSGP and MCSGE of experiment ExpA 
 {\bf Hypothesis 0}: mean(Generations of MCSGP)=6.7 - mean(Generations of MCSGE)=53.8 is equal to 0.
