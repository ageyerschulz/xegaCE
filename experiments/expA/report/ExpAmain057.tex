 The test-statistic W of the Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction is 6978 with a p-value of 0 .
 Since the p-value 0 is below the significance level $\alpha= 0.05 $,
 for variable Generations of treatments SQSGP and SQSGE of experiment ExpA 
 {\bf Hypothesis 0}: mean(Generations of SQSGP)=6.7 - mean(Generations of SQSGE)=42.3 is equal to 0.
