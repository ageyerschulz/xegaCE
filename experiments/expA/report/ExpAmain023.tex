Should we prefer multi-core or sequential processing?
}
For each agorithm we have to test:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Is the multi-core version faster (in seconds) than the sequential version?
 
\item Do both of them need the same resources (in generations)?
\end{enumerate}
Multi-core processing is only preferable if it is faster (in seconds)
when running for the same number of generations.
 
The evaluation of the population of genes is parallelized.
