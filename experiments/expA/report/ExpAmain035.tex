{\bf Hypothesis 0}: mean(Generations of MCSGE)=17.4 - mean(Generations of SQSGE)=18.7 is equal to 0.


 \begin{center} is tested at a significance level 0.05 against: \end{center}

{\bf Hypothesis 1}: mean(Generations of MCSGE)=17.4 - mean(Generations of SQSGE)=18.7 is not equal to 0.

 23 outliers of treatment MCSGE are removed (coef=1.5).

 24 outliers of treatment SQSGE are removed (coef=1.5).

 The test-statistic W of the Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction is 14638 with a p-value of 0.328 .
 Since the p-value 0.328 is above the significance level $\alpha= 0.05 $,
 for variable Generations of treatments MCSGE and SQSGE of experiment ExpA 
 {\bf Hypothesis 0}: mean(Generations of MCSGE)=17.4 - mean(Generations of SQSGE)=18.7 is equal to 0.
