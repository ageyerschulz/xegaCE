 The test-statistic W of the Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction is 15850 with a p-value of 0.00033 .
 Since the p-value 0.00033 is below the significance level $\alpha= 0.05 $,
 for variable Seconds of treatments SQSGE and SQSGV of experiment ExpA 
 {\bf Hypothesis 0}: mean(Seconds of SQSGE)=32.5 - mean(Seconds of SQSGV)=36 is equal to 0.
