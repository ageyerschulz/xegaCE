The experiment has two control variables:
 
{\tt exectionModel} with 2 levels: {\tt "Sequential"} and {\tt "MultiCore"}.
 
{\tt algorithm} with 3 levels: {\tt "sgp"}, {\tt "sge"} and {\tt "sgede"} .
 
We investigate sequential versus multicore execution and
 
the performance of the three algorithms.
