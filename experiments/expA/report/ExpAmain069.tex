 Outliers of treatment MCSGE  are not removed (coef=0).

 Outliers of treatment MCSGV  are not removed (coef=0).

 The test-statistic W of the Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction is 8326 with a p-value of 1 .
 Since the p-value 1 is above the significance level $\alpha= 0.05 $,
 for variable Seconds of treatments MCSGE and MCSGV of experiment ExpA 
 {\bf Hypothesis 0}: mean(Seconds of MCSGE)=12.9 - mean(Seconds of MCSGV)=32.8 is equal or less than 0.
is {\bf accepted}.
