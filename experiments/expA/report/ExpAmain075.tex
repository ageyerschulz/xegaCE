 The test-statistic W of the Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction is 12576 with a p-value of 1 .
 Since the p-value 1 is above the significance level $\alpha= 0.05 $,
 for variable Generations of treatments MCSGP and MCSGV of experiment ExpA 
 {\bf Hypothesis 0}: mean(Generations of MCSGP)=6.7 - mean(Generations of MCSGV)=13.7 is equal or less than 0.
