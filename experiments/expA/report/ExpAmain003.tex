Description of Experiment
}
The purpose of this computational experiment is
to compare sequential ({\tt executionModel="Sequential"})
and multicore ({\tt executionModel="MultiCore"}) processing
for each algorithm,
and to establish a performance ranking of the three algorithms
grammar-based genetic programming ({\tt algorithm="sgp"}),
grammatical evolution ({\tt algorithm="sge"}), and
grammatical evolution by differential evolution ({\tt algorithm="sgede"}).
 
The {\bf problem environment} is the 3-symmetry problem:
Finding a boolean expression (with the nand function)
which is TRUE for symmetric 3-bit strings.
 
The {\bf solver} used is {\tt xegaRun} from the R-package {\tt xega}.
 
The experiment consists of 6 treatments, namely the sequential and
multicore version of each of the 3 algorithms.
