 The test-statistic W of the Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction is 9899 with a p-value of 0 .
 Since the p-value 0 is below the significance level $\alpha= 0.05 $,
 for variable Seconds of treatments SQSGP and SQSGE of experiment ExpA 
 {\bf Hypothesis 0}: mean(Seconds of SQSGP)=10.7 - mean(Seconds of SQSGE)=32.5 is equal to 0.
