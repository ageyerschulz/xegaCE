Description: The execution of a computational experiment 
             has three phases, all of which are 
             supported: (1) The repeated execution of the trials of a treatment 
             of an experiment is supported by one command dispatcher
             which records and summarizes the parameters of a treatment 
             and its repeated trials in periodic snapshots. 
             (2) Snapshots are merged, one data set for each treatment.
             (3) For report writing, a small language is provided,
             for generating descriptive statistics, hypothesis tests, 
             and a few graphics.
